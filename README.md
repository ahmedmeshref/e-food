# e-resturant
We are heading to a new digital world where the machines are going to help humans
to do everything. We got inspired by the world around us and the digitalization happening
everywhere to build a full cashier for a restaurant without any human interaction and solve the problem of customers waiting in the 
resturant. Our customer will be talking to chatbot who will show him the menu and help him to decide which meal to
choose if he wants. Then, the order will be made to the kitchen and the chatbot will enable the
online payment to our user and verified it for him with a receipt.

Features:
Our program will have two kinds of users interacting:
1. Superuser or admin: Those users will login with a password to and they will have
different features:
a. They will be able to view all orders and the total revenue.
b. Manipulating the items available in the storage: add items, remove items, update
items information (the price, the descriptionâ€¦).
c. Check the user ratings of the food and suggestions for improving the service.
2. Ordinary user or customer: Those are the ones who interact indirectly with the
program:
a. They will interact with the chatbot to show the menu, pay online,... etc.
b. They will be able to see our online menu and select the food or the drinks they
want.
c. They will be able to select the number of items they ordered.
d. They will be able to pay online with their visa card.
e. They will be able to rate the order they got and give feedback to improve if the
like.
